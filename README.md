# Image-Data-Analyzer-
This project performs a low-level statistical analysis of digital images using Python, NumPy, and PIL, without relying on high-level image processing libraries for understanding image data numerically by examining pixel distributions, color channel behavior, brightness, and histogram-based intensity segmentation.

The project supports both RGB and grayscale images and compares multiple images to determine relative brightness.

# Key Concepts Used -

Digital image representation as NumPy arrays

RGB color channels

Grayscale vs RGB handling

Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, min, max)

Histogram-based intensity analysis

Brightness comparison using pixel averages

# Tech Stack -

Python

NumPy – numerical computation on pixel data

Pillow (PIL) – image loading and color conversion
